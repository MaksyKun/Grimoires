# Using mysteries allows users to interact with a book to find specific words
# in order to solve an encryption and get a reward. Those rewards can be
# rather commands or spells through addons of other plugins

# This feature is staff only since it allows to use op commands for solving books
# Adding support for common players might be considered if you have a great idea of how to do it
# You can make suggestions here: https://github.com/MaksyKun/Grimoires/issues

# Encryption is kind of tricky to handle. You use the indicator before a word
# that you want to use for a mystery. Further information underneath:
# - 'Indicator' is the symbol that will be used to indicate a word as encrypted. Use this before a word to encrypt it
# - If the 'WordLimit' is reached, remaining words will be formatted to normal text again.
# - 'Design' will show the encrypted words highlighted, else, just use "%word%" to show the plain word in the book
# - 'ResetOnFail' will reset the encryption if the player fails to solve by clicking wrong words if an exact order is required
# Detailed information on Encryption can be found in the wiki
